## Installation

### Using Homebrew

Until Fresco hasn't gained minimal popularity, we don't have the opportunity to publish the formula in the [homebrew-core repository](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core). Nevertheless, we recommend using homebrew to install Fresco from sources.

```sh
curl -o fresco.rb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanyauhalin/Fresco/main/fresco.rb
brew install --build-from-source fresco.rb
```

### Using Binary

Download the [latest release binary](https://github.com/vanyauhalin/Fresco/releases) and unzip it.
